Deploy Security Provider

/etc/config.properties:
org.apache.karaf.security.providers = org.bouncycastle.jce.provider.BouncyCastleProvider

org.osgi.framework.bootdelegation = ...,org.bouncycastle*

NPN:
org.osgi.framework.bootdelegation = ...,org.eclipse.jetty.npn

For jetty distribution, to run SPDY:
       java  -Xbootclasspath/p:npn-boot-1.1.5.v20130313.jar -jar start.jar OPTIONS=spdy

Starting in OSGi

To use NPN in an OSGi environment, in addition to putting the NPN jar on the boot classpath for the container, you will also need to deploy the jetty-osgi-npn jar. This jar contains a Fragment-Host directive that ensures the NPN classes will be available from the system bundle.

You can download the jetty-osgi-npn jar from maven central: http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/eclipse/jetty/osgi/jetty-osgi-npn/

It's useful to look at the full stack trace. You could also use -Djavax.net.debug=ssl, or at least -Djavax.net.debug=ssl,keymanager, to get more debugging information, if the information in the stack trace isn't sufficient.

etc:
   Using the xml configuration files in jetty-osgi/jetty-osgi-boot/jettyhome. In jetty 9 final, it simplfy the configuration of web app in OSGi enviroment.(no need to configure OSGi-specific deployer or web provider explicity.

Debug Karaf

Before you'll start karaf set environment option KARAF_DEBUG to 1. After 
that Karaf will start VM with additional parameters to let connect you from 
debugger. After that you can debug it as remote java application in Eclipse. 

EXPORT KARAF_DEBUG=1

Debuging NPN

You can enable debug logging for the NPN extension by adding the following line to the Java code you use to start up the server:

NextProtoNego.debug = true;

Since the NextProtoNego class is in the boot classpath, we chose not to use logging libraries because we do not want to override application logging library choices; therefore the logging is performed directly on System.err.
