Karaf Deployment Guide - Feature-Based

1. Karaf for Jetty 8.0.4
 
  (1) karaf-src\pom.xml
        <pax.web.version>2.0.0-SNAPSHOT</pax.web.version>
 

2 Jetty

(1) geronimo-jaspi changed to export: 
    org.apache.geronimo.components.jaspi.impl;version=2.0
    
(2) wab-sample-loginmodule is a bundle for register a jaas realm by blueprint. jetty-osgi-boot cannot deal with this. It seems
    that because jetty-osgi-boot intercept the bundle deployment event, blueprint not process the bundle again.

(3) jetty-osgi-boot:
   there is duplicate import for org.eclipse.jetty.osgi.nestedin META-INF/MANIFEST.MF
   
   It seems to be solved in Jetty 8.1.
   
(4) jetty-plus: add import for javax.security.*
    this will be solved in 8.1.x

3. startup.properties

added:
  org.osgi.compendium-4.2.0.jar=5
  servlet-api-3.0.jar=5
or requirement in deploy directory cannot be resolved for http service and http servlet
